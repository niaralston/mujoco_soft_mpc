<!-- 
This MuJoCo model simulates a deformable sphere using radial flex components.
The sphere can interact with its environment and deform based on physical forces.

Key concepts:
- Instead of using a single deformable sphere, this simulation uses a grid of particles (8x8x8)
  to achieve more realistic and complex deformations
- The particles are connected by edges with specific properties that control how they interact
- The simulation includes both visual markers and the actual deformable structure
-->

<mujoco model="Radial flex sphere">
  <!-- Include standard scene settings from an external file -->
  <include file="scene.xml"/>

  <!-- Simulation parameters:
       - Using Conjugate Gradient (CG) solver for physics calculations
       - High precision tolerance of 1e-6
       - Small timestep of 0.001s for stable simulation
       - Using fast implicit integration for better performance

       - Map stiffness controls how force vectors are displayed

           - Pure visualization (contype/conaffinity=0 means no collision)
           - Group 4 is commonly used for visual reference markers
           - This marker is not required for simulation, only helps visualize the body's center

      <!-- Flexible component defining the deformable sphere:
           Why use multiple particles instead of one sphere?
           - Creates an 8x8x8 grid (512 particles) for more realistic deformation
           - Allows complex behaviors like localized squishing and stretching
           - Each particle can move semi-independently while staying connected
           - More accurate physics simulation than a single deformable unit
           
           Parameters explained:
           - type="ellipsoid": Creates particles in an ellipsoid shape
           - count="8 8 8": Creates 8x8x8 grid of particles (512 total)
           - spacing=".07 .07 .07": Distance between particles
           - radius=".001": Size of each individual particle
           - rgba="0 .7 .7 1": Cyan color for visualization
           - mass="5": Total mass distributed across all particles

        <!-- Edge properties controlling how particles connect and interact:
             - equality="true": Makes edges try to maintain equal lengths for uniform deformation
             - solimp="0 0.9 0.01": Solver impedance parameters
               * 0: No damping
               * 0.9: High restitution (bouncy)
               * 0.01: Small force-dependent slip
             - solref=".02 1": Solver reference parameters
               * .02: Time constant (affects stiffness)
               * 1: Damping ratio
             
             These parameters together control how "stretchy" and "springy" the sphere is,
             and how it maintains its shape during and after deformation.

             - internal="false": Disables internal contact force calculations within the sphere
               (we don't need to calculate pressure forces inside the structure)
             Both settings are off since particle relationships are handled by edge connections -->
