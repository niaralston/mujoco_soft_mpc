<!-- 
This MuJoCo model creates a basic deformable sphere using flex components.
Unlike the radial or trilinear models, this one uses a simpler approach with
just edge-based connections between particles.

Key concepts:
- Uses a basic flex component without specialized deformation methods
- Demonstrates the simplest way to create a deformable object
- Shape maintained purely through edge connections between particles

  <!-- Simulation parameters:
       - Using Conjugate Gradient (CG) solver for physics calculations
       - High precision tolerance for stable behavior
       - Small timestep for numerical stability
       - Fast implicit integration for better performance

    <!-- Force Visualization Control:
         - Press 'F' key in viewer to show force arrows
         - stiffness=500 controls arrow size scaling:
           * Higher value (e.g. 500) = shorter arrows
           * Lower value (e.g. 100) = longer arrows
         - This is just a visualization setting, doesn't affect physics
         - All forces are shown regardless of magnitude, just scaled differently
